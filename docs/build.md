# Building the broker

To build the broker from source code, you'll need [Rust] installed. We
currently support Rust 1.72 and newer.

[rust]: https://www.rust-lang.org/

Once installed, building the broker is straight-forward:

```bash
cargo build
```

To then run the broker:

```bash
./target/debug/portier-broker[.exe] [config.toml]
```

Or both steps combined:

```bash
cargo run -- [config.toml]
```

To make a release build, add `--release` to the Cargo commands. See the [Cargo
manual] for more information.

## Feature flags

Cargo supports feature flags to customize a build. These can be enabled with
`--features` on the Cargo command-line, which takes a space or comma separated
list of feature flags.

The broker has some feature flags enabled by default. If you're going to
customize your build, you may want to add `--no-default-features` to your Cargo
command-line to start from zero, then selectively enable the exact feature
flags you want.

The broker currently defines the following feature flags:

- `rustls`: Uses [rustls] for TLS connectivity. (Enabled by default.) Root
  certificates are loaded from the system root store. This feature conflicts
  with `native-tls`.

- `native-tls`: Uses the platform native TLS library via the
  [native-tls crate]. This feature conflicts with `rustls`.

- `rsa`: Uses the [rsa crate] to generate RSA keys. Without this feature, an
  external command must be provided to generate RSA keys (via the
  `generate_rsa_command` setting).

- `redis`: Enables [Redis] storage support using the [redis crate]. (Enabled by
  default.)

- `rusqlite`: Enables [SQLite] storage support using the [rusqlite crate].
  (Enabled by default.)

- `lettre_smtp`: Enables sending mail using SMTP, via the [lettre
  crate]. (Enabled by default.)

- `lettre_smtp`: Enables sending mail using the `sendmail` command, via the
  [lettre crate]. (Enabled by default.)

- `postmark`: Enables sending mail using the [Postmark] API. (Enabled by
  default.)

- `mailgun`: Enables sending mail using the [Mailgun] API. (Enabled by
  default.)

- `sendgrid`: Enables sending mail using the [SendGrid] API. (Enabled by
  default.)

- `insecure`: Uses plain HTTP for WebFinger (instead of HTTPS), and allows
  Identity Providers to use plain HTTP in their discovery documents. Useful for
  testing Identity Provider implementations.

## Testing

The broker code includes some unit tests which can be run using:

```bash
cargo test
```

Also included is an end-to-end test, in `tests/e2e`. See [README.md] in that
directory for instructions on how to run it.
