# Portier Broker configuration template
#
# All settings in this template are listed with their defaults. If the default
# value of a setting is fine, you can leave the setting out of your
# configuration.
#
# If a setting in this template is commented, that means it is unset by
# default, and any value listed is an example only.
#
# Alternatively, the broker can be configured using the environment. Each
# setting here has a matching `BROKER_*` environment variable. For example,
# `public_url` can also be set using the `BROKER_PUBLIC_URL` environment
# variable.
#
# Configuration from the environment takes precedence over the configuration
# file. (It's also possible to use the environment only, without a
# configuration file.)

################################################################
# Basic settings

# The IP address and port to bind the HTTP server to. Note that `listen_ip`
# accepts IPv4 and IPv6, but currently not hostnames.
# 
# Alternatively, you may use systemd socket activation to pass in a listening
# socket, in which case these settings are ignored. (See the included systemd
# unit file.)
#
# Also note that the broker currently only talks plain HTTP, and not HTTPS.
# Using HTTPS is strongly recommended, but you'll need to add a reverse proxy
# in front of the broker to do this. (Apache or Nginx can do this for you.)
#
# If using the Docker image, you can leave these settings out of your config.

listen_ip = "127.0.0.1"
listen_port = 3333

# The broker server's public-facing URL.
#
# It's important to set this correctly, or JSON Web Tokens will fail to
# validate. Relying Parties will use the same value for their Broker URL. To
# ensure consistency, trailing slashes should be avoided.

public_url = "" # Required

# Whitelist of origins that are allowed to use this broker. If left unset, the
# broker will allow any Relying Party to use it. (Note that an empty list here
# has different meaning than leaving it unset.)

#allowed_origins = ["https://example.com"]

# The 'From' name and address used by Portier to send emails.

from_name = "Portier"

# Optional Google Client ID for verifying `@gmail.com` addresses.
# You can create one of these at: https://console.cloud.google.com/

#google_client_id = ""

# To generate RSA keys, the broker runs an external command. By default, this
# looks for the OpenSSL CLI in `$PATH`, but you may need to change this for
# your environment. Whatever command you specify here should output a single
# PEM key on stdout.
#
# Using automatic key rotation is strongly recommended, but if you cannot
# provide a working value for this setting, it's possible to manually configure
# keys. See the `keyfiles` and `keytext` options in the advanced section for
# how to do this.

# Storage

# Selecting one of these storage methods is required.
#
# For simple installations, SQLite is recommended. Alternatively, Redis can be
# useful when running multiple instances of the broker, or when there's no
# persistent file storage. This is common with cloud hosting, like Heroku.

# Setting `sqlite_db` enables SQLite storage. Please also read:
# https://github.com/portier/portier-broker/blob/master/docs/storage/sqlite.md

#sqlite_db = "/var/lib/portier-broker/db.sqlite3"

# Setting `redis_url` enables Redis storage. Please also read:
# https://github.com/portier/portier-broker/blob/master/docs/storage/redis.md

#redis_url = "redis://localhost/0"

# Setting `memory_storage` enables in-memory storage. This should only be used
# for local testing.

################################################################
# Sending mail

# Selecting one of these methods to send mail is required.
#
# If you're looking for an easy way to test the broker locally, consider using
# SMTP with Mailhog: https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog

# Setting `smtp_server` enables SMTP to send mail. The value should be a
# hostname or IP address, and may optionally have a port. (If not specified,
# port 25 is used.) The `smtp_username` and `smtp_password` fields are
# optional.

#smtp_server = ""
#smtp_username = ""
#smtp_password = ""

# Setting `sendmail_command` enables sending mail using the given `sendmail`
# executable. The path in this example is usually the correct one.

#sendmail_command = "/usr/sbin/sendmail"

# Setting `postmark_token` enables sending mail using the Postmark API. The
# value is a Postmark server API token.

# By default, the broker automatically generates and rotates keys used to sign
# JSON Web Tokens. If for some reason you wish to provide keys manually, you
# can do so with these settings.
#
# Only PEM format is accepted, but the `keytext` and each file in `keyfiles`
# may contain multiple PEM blocks. The broker will list all public keys in API
# responses, but will only use the last key for signing.

# Signing algorithms to use for JSON Web Tokens. Currently supported values
# are: RS256, EdDSA. The protocol for selecting algorithms other than RS256 is
# experimental and non-standard, so by default only RS256 is enabled.

# WebFinger overrides

# The broker uses WebFinger to discover domains that provide custom
# authentication. If WebFinger cannot be configured on a domain, custom
# overrides can be configured with sections like the ones below. (Note that it
# is currently not possible to configure these overrides using environment
# variables.)

# The following example enables Google authentication for a domain. Note that
# both `rel` and `href` should be treated as magic constants.

#[[domain_overrides."example.com"]]
#rel = "https://portier.io/specs/auth/1.0/idp/google"
#href = "https://accounts.google.com"

# The following example configures a custom Portier Identity Provider for a
# domain. Note that `rel` here should be treated as a magic constant, and
# `href` points to the actual Identity Provider implementation.

#[[domain_overrides."example.com"]]
#rel = "https://portier.io/specs/auth/1.0/idp"
#href = "https://identity-provider.example.com"
